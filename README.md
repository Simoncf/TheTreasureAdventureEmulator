# TheTreasureAdventureEmulator
This is a treasure adventure game/ emulator
This game generates a maze with one treasure and several traps.
You cannot see the walls, traps or tressure untill you find them.
Navegate using the keys (N, S, W, E) viseted areas is indecated with the letter v.
you can exit the game at any time using the esc key.



## Posseble fixes for the future
The maze can generate a maze that is impossoible to win,
this is quite rare but is possible because the maze is randomly generated. 

You press the key twise to navigate, you should only need to press the key once to navigate (Nice to have).
